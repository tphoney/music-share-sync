This library is based on the open source project found here:
http://code.google.com/p/tree-view-list-android/

With some tweaks to fit in with the music-hare-sync-reacdonly project
1. Package Renaming
2. Removal of any demo-able screens/activity - it is now a pure library
3. Changes to demo_list_item.xml to remove the display of a 'level'/depth value of the node within the tree
4. Changes to the state management of nodes, to allow the injection of a description field (the folder/node name) during creation of a node, as
	well as the exposure of the descripion attribute getters/setters on the Ui api side of the (InstateTreeStateMemory/TreenodeInfo)

This is a small utility that provides quite configurable tree view list.
It is based on standard android list view. It separates out different
aspects of the tree: there is a separate list view, tree adapter, tree
state manager and tree state builder.
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Tree view provides the frame to display the view.</li>
	<li>Adapter allows to create visual representation of each tree
	node.</li>
	<li>State manager provides storage for tree state (connections
	between parents and children, collapsed/expanded state). It provides
	all the low-level tree manipulation methods.</li>
	<li>Tree builder allows to build tree easily providing higher
	level methods. The tree can be build either from prepared sequentially
	prepared list of nodes (node id, level) or using (parent/child
	relationships).</li>
	<p>For now only in-memory state manager is provided, but Tree State
	Manger interface is done in the way that database tree manager even for
	large trees is potentially supported.
</ul>
